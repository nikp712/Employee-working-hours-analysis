# Employees Working Hours Analysis (R)
Analysis of employee working hours using R for statistical summaries and visualizations

## Overview

This project explores and visualises employee working hours data using R, incorporating descriptive statistics, outlier detection, and demographic breakdowns to provide actionable insights for HR management and workforce planning.

## Objectives

- Summarize employee working hours with key statistics (mean, median, range, variance, etc.)
- Visualize work hour distribution using barplots and boxplots
- Detect and display outliers (e.g., staff working >60 hours)
- Analyze gender proportions and long working hour patterns
- Provide code that’s clear, reusable, and portfolio-ready

## Methodology

1. **Statistical Analysis:**  
   - Calculate central tendency and spread (mean, median, variance, sd, IQR)
   - Identify outliers and display with boxplot.stats
2. **Visualization:**  
   - Barplot for the distribution of working hours  
   - Boxplot for range and outliers  
   - Scatterplot for staff working >40 hours  
   - Barplot for gender (Sex) proportion
3. **Subgroup Analysis:**  
   - List staff working >40 and >60 hours, and filter by gender
   - Extract and display targeted columns for deeper inspection

## Files

- `Employees-working-hours-analysis.R` — The R script for all analysis and plots
- *(Your data file, e.g. `ISYS3446_A1_IntelliAuto-1.xlsx`, not included for privacy)*

## Key Results

- Identified average, median, and range of staff working hours.
- Highlighted employees working excessive hours (>60), enabling targeted HR intervention.
- Visualized gender breakdown and long-hour staff as part of workforce planning.

## Sample Visualizations

- **Barplot:** Number of employees by working hours  
- **Boxplot:** Range and outlier analysis for working hours  
- **Scatterplot:** Employees working more than 40 hours  
- **Barplot:** Gender (Sex) proportions

*(You can add image links here if you save plots, e.g. `![Boxplot](boxplot.png)`)*
  
## How to Use

1. Place your dataset (e.g., `ISYS3446_A1_IntelliAuto-1.xlsx`) in your R working directory.
2. Open `Employees-working-hours-analysis.R` in RStudio.
3. Adjust the script to load your data frame if needed.
4. Run the script section by section to reproduce statistics and plots.
