## Overview
This project analyzes employee HR data to explore trends in working hours, gender diversity, and promotion readiness. Using R for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, the project provides workforce insights for informed decision making.

---

## Project Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Work hours, gender, experience, and promotions.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and outliers for quality insights.
- **Statistical Summaries:** Mean, median, variance, outlier checks.
- **Visual Analytics:** Informative barplots, boxplots, and scatterplots.
- **Promotion Analysis:** Initial regression modelling for succession planning.

---

## Data Summary
- **Dataset:** Employee records from [ISYS3446_A1_IntelliAuto-1.xlsx]
- **Key Columns:**
    - `WorkHrs`, `Sex`, `Age`, `WrkYears`, `FutPromo`, `Occupation`

---

## Preprocessing Steps
1. Imported and reviewed the dataset.
2. Checked for and addressed missing values.
3. Transformed/standardized variable names and data types.
4. Identified outliers in work hours for further review.

## Visualizations and Analysis

1. Number of Working Hours
   
   This barplot summarizes the frequency distribution of working hours among employees.

3. Boxplot for Working Hours of Employee
   
   This boxplot presents the distribution of employee working hours.

3. Employees Working over 40 Hours
   
   This scatterplot visualizes which employees work more than 40 hours per week.

## Key Insights
- Slightly more male than female employees; gender diversity can be improved.
- Many staff exceed 40 working hours per weekâ€”potential overwork risk.
- Most employees have standard working weeks, but several are clear outliers.
- Regression and boxplot analysis show that age and experience influence promotion readiness.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-hr-analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd employee-hr-analysis
    ```
3. Run the analysis script (R):
    ```bash
    Rscript employee_analysis.R
    ```
    *or run the Jupyter Notebook version if provided.*

---

## Results
- All plots successfully generated.
- Outliers flagged for review.
- Initial regression points to experience and age as promotion predictors.

---

## Future Improvements
- Enhance regression modelling (add more features, use machine learning).
- Build an interactive dashboard (e.g., R Shiny, Tableau).
- Expand demographic analysis (department, tenure, performance).
